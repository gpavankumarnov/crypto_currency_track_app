--------------Concepts to Learn from this Project--------------------

useContext API - how to use.

toFixed(number)-  which converts the number to string and number passed in args tells the number of decimals  required.

replace  - used on string to replace the string with given regex.

react-alice-carousel - npm library to build carousel.

MaterialUI - Material UI components help us in building UI faster.
           Components used in this project are: 
                                               - Select(as select tag for dropdown), 
                                               - MenuItem(as options tag in dropdown).
                                               - Typography for text, title, brand name, etc,
                                               

MaterialUI styles -  makeStyles => it takes a arrow function and return as object -> where each property is another object with styles defined in it.

mapping list of items - instead of doing map in component return, doing it outside and storing in variable. that variable calling in return statement to avoid code complexity.































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
